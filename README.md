# Gesture Controlled VR

## What is this?
- This project allows for the control of a VR scene through Gesture Control.

## Project Structure
- The `echo-server`Â directory contains a simple Node.js websocket server which broadcasts data it recieves to all subscribed clients.
- The `Virtual Office` directory contains a Unity scene which subscribes to a websocket server and logs any received messages.

- Setting up the `echo-server` app
```
cd echo-server
npm install
npm start
```
